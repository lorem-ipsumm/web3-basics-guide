# web3-basics-guide
This repo holds the code for a guide that will walk readers through the basic skills needed to be a Web3 developer. It won't cover Solidity
programming, and mostly focuses on the Javascript aspect of Web3 but exposes readers to smart contracts. The core focus of the guide is to get 
people comfortable with the basics of reading/writing data from a blockchain. 

Full Guide (still a work in progress):
